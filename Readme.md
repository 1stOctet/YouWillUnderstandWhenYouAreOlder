I keep hearing about school closings and wonder how I can "encourage" my son and daughter to spend a little less time on social media and more time learning.

With the awesome per client features of Pi-hole 5.0 beta it will now be possible to add the ability to periodically block sites and unlock them after points are earned on khan academy, typing club or any site that has a web scrapable point system.
